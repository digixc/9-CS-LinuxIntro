- An operating system is software that controls computer hardware and software.
- There are many different operating systems you can use to control a computer; you're probably familiar with some of these already both on PC and mobile.
   - Microsoft Windows 10
   - Apple MacOS X El Capitan
   - Google Chrome OS
   - Apple iOS
   - Google Android
- One you may not have heard of is Linux. Unlike all the Operating Systems named above, this one isn't written by a company, but instead is written and maintained by individuals around the world, who collaborate together to produce a free, open-source platform for users.  
- Open source means that anyone can look at the code the operating system runs on, see exactly how it works and modify it to meet their own requirements.

- Linux was released to the word in October 1991, when [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds][Linus Torvalds]] released his home-made operating system for others to use. 
- A year after its release, Linus posted on an online newsgroup, requesting that anyone using his new OS should send him a postcard. He was inundated with postcards from around the world very quickly, leading his family to suspect that something big was happening!

- Linux can be used in various different desktop environments, so it can be customised to look however you want. Users can install several at once, and have a different experience every time they boot their computer. 
- Find screenshots on four of the following Linux desktop environments, and put them on a word document.
   - GNOME
   - Raspbian (used on Raspberry Pi computers)
   - KDE
   - Unity
   - Xfce
   - Cinnamon
   - Xmonad
   - MATE
   - LXDE

- Answer as many of the following questions as possible to collect the badges.
- *Silver:* One Linux graphical desktop environment is 'GNOME'. Find out about three others, and write a sentence about what makes each unique. If you're writing your answers in Word, you could include a screenshot of each.
- *Gold:* Write a short piece explaining the history of Linux. Include:
   - What operating system it's based on,
   - When it came out,
   - At least 3 Linux facts.
- *Platinum:* Linux users often use the command line. Find out three different commands, and /briefly/ explain what they do.
