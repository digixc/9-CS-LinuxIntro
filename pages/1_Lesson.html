<li>An operating system is software that controls computer hardware and software.

<li>There are many different operating systems you can use to control a computer; you're probably familiar with some of these already both on PC and mobile.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Microsoft Windows 10

<li>Apple MacOS X El Capitan

<li>Google Chrome OS

<li>One you may not have heard of is Linux. Unlike all the Operating Systems named above, this one isn't written by a company, but instead is written and maintained by individuals around the world, who collaborate together to produce a free, open-source platform for users.  
</li>
<li>Open source means that anyone can look at the code the operating system runs on, see exactly how it works and modify it to meet their own requirements.

<li>Linux was released to the word in October 1991, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> released his home-made operating system for others to use. 
</li>
<li>A year after its release, Linus posted on an online newsgroup, requesting that anyone using his new OS should send him a postcard. He was inundated with postcards from around the world very quickly, leading his family to suspect that something big was happening!
